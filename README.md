## Summary of project goals ########
####################################

# The purpose of this project is to look at the inflation to the dollar
# caused by COVID-19 related economic fallout, including stimulus and unemployment
# This was inspired by seeing the price of SLV (silver spot price etf) rise about 83%
# from the march COVID-19 crash of 2020 to July of that same year. Gold has followed a similar,
# but not as extreme pattern. Stock prices have also recovered and then gone on to
# reach all-time highs. This was spurred on by Powell saying last week that he wants to
# raise the inflation goal to 2.5% , and seeing him saying that he sees no signs of current inflation.
#
# To me, there seems to be some discrepancy between what the precious metals are saying,
# and what Powell says. To me there is no good reason silver should have doubled in price.
# I think there is inflation happening outside of what Powell sees, and there is no way
# this could have been evened out by job losses when we have the first stimulus, unless
# he is seeing severe repercussions for the lag in a second effective stimulus outside of
# what has been offered by recent executive orders. On top of this I fail to believe that the
# CPI could faithfully represent inflation recently due to supply chain issues,
# and specifically the case where restaurants shutting down has affected how people consume
# the basic items used in the CPI. This is just a gut instinct.
# I would like to use this first data science blog post to either prove myself right or wrong
